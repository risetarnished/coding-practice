 * Given an array of integers, sort the elements in the array in ascending order. The quick sort algorithm should be used to solve this problem.
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * {1} is sorted to {1}
 * {1, 2, 3} is sorted to {1, 2, 3}
 * {3, 2, 1} is sorted to {1, 2, 3}
 * {4, 2, -3, 6, 1} is sorted to {-3, 1, 2, 4, 6}
